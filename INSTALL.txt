This project requires Gnu Flex for lexer generation. You may download it from: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
Embree is required for ray tracing. You may download it from: https://embree.github.io/
Qt is required for GUIs. You may download it from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

Windows is the main development platform; however, we support Linux to some extend. Everything that uses CPU for rendering should work.
GPU rendering is driver vendor related.

We have support for CUDA. You may remove it by using -DDISABLE_CUDA=on when doing the cmake configuration.

This project is provided in hope that it is useful for other researchers. We do not claim production quality or fit for any other purpose
than learning about the techniques that we have developed.
